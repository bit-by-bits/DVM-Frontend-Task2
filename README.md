# A VENDOR LIST
### 'Trust Your Vendor'

This project holds a well-functional, easy-to-use Vendor List for tracking goods' ordering/receiving dates.

Solely developed by myself for DVM round-2, I incorporated in it a stealthy modern design, hoping that users could manage any important deliveries without any difficulties.

It provides features like local storage manipulation (to store your data, hence backend is not needed), form validation (to avoid any mishaps), and the option of searching through the records (by javascript, to avoid long scrolling).
